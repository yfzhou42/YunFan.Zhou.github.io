      <description>I&#39;m starting this blog to share research ideas that I have, and some solutions to problems I find along the way. I&#39;ve been helped immensely by other people&#39;s blogs in the past, and want to do the same. Also it&#39;ll give me a chance to communicate the way I approach problems, and hopefully people will give me alternative perspectives either by email (rachitsingh@college.harvard.edu) or in the comments, once I figure out how that works.</description>

      <description>Ideas for libraries (so that people can use this stuff quickly)
 Implement a discrete Poisson distribution using RELAX/REBAR and/or the TRE. Reimplement the CUDA code for unbiased MCMC so that it&amp;rsquo;s PyTorch based, if that&amp;rsquo;s possible. That way we can let people define arbitrary likelihoods and still get coupled kernels. Maybe use CuPy as a glue language, though if the PyTorch story for external modules gets better then this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be an issue.</description>
