## About Me

I am a third year PhD student at [NYU Geometric Computing Lab](https://cims.nyu.edu/gcl/index.html). My professors are Daniele Panozzo and Denis Zorin. I'm interseted in geometry processing, modeling, and graphics related topics. 

Life-wise interests include arting in numerous museums and galleries in New York. Bouldering is an old love. Silk dance has been the new interest. Find me in room 560, 60
5th Ave, the one right next to men's bathroom filled with overgrown jackfruits and air-plants. When you are visiting, select a tea among my broad selection that my parents sponsored from Henan, China. Or allow me to make you a cappucino. I have been honing the sacred skill of barista since 2021. Hope you like light-roast beans though. Also, been learning Italian for a year or two. A bit more advanced than "Ciao, come sei". But still far away from reading Calvino in his native language.
